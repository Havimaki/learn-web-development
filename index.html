      <h2>Adding styles</h2>
      <p>
        In this module, you learn how to add styles using a stylsheet
      </p>
      <p>
        So what's a stylesheet? It's a file typically ending with .css that contains a collection of rules that dictate
        to the browser how the HTML tags will be presented in the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        A stylesheet must be linked through a `link` tag, and placed within the head. If you remember from the first
        module on HTML, the head contains all metadata, links and scripts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cool, cool... so how does it woork?
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice the `class=""`'s and/or `id=""`'s'
        added to all these tags. The rules in the stylesheet are grouped by
        classes and ids. The class and/or id is then applied to an HTML tag as a way to inherit those styles.
      </p>
      <p id="id-one" class="class-one class-two">
        A tag can have multiple classes, but it can only have a max of one id. If a tag does have more than one class,
        each class name must be separated by a space.
